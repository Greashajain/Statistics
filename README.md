# 📊 Statistical Tests in Python

This repository contains implementations of key statistical hypothesis tests using Python and `scipy.stats`, created in Google Colab. It serves as a practical reference for understanding how different statistical tests work and how to apply them to real data.

## 📁 Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ZTest.ipynb` | Performs z-tests for population mean comparison (when population std is known). |
